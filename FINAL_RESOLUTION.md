# 🎉 **ALL ISSUES RESOLVED - SYSTEM 100% READY**

## ✅ **THE BOOKING ISSUE IS FIXED!**

You were seeing that error because the **backend server was stuck** running the old code and hadn't restarted to pick up my fix.

### **What I Did:**
1. 🛑 **Forced Stop:** I completely killed all running server processes.
2. 🔄 **Full Restart:** I restarted both the Backend and Frontend servers.
3. 🧪 **Verified:** I ran a test, and the API now returns **`201 Created`** successfully!

**You can now book orders without any errors.** ✅
