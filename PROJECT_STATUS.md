#### Fixed React Hook Warnings:

- Added `useCallback` to `fetchQueries` in `Queries.tsx`
- Fixed exhaustive-deps warnings in useEffect hooks

### 4. Remaining Warnings (Non-Critical) ⚠️

8 warnings about React Fast Refresh best practices:
- `badge.tsx`, `button.tsx`, `form.tsx`, `navigation-menu.tsx`, `sidebar.tsx`, `sonner.tsx`, `toggle.tsx`, `useAuth.tsx`
- These are UI component library files that export helper functions alongside components
- **Impact:** None - These warnings don't affect functionality, only Fast Refresh optimization
